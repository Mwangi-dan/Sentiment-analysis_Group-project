# Sentiment-analysis_Group-project

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

# Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets. The goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative based on their content. The project involves several steps, including data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and sentiment classification using machine learning models.

# Files
. Twitter_sentiment_analysis_Group6.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, EDA, and sentiment analysis.

. Twitter_Sentiments.csv: The dataset used for the analysis, stored in the Data folder.

. README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for reproducing the results.

# Instructions for Reproducing Results

1. Setting Up the Environment
To run the Jupyter notebook and reproduce the results, you need to set up a Python environment with the required libraries. You can do this by following these steps:

a. Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
b. Install Required Libraries (Via collabs)

2. Downloading the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Twitter_Sentiments.csv. Ensure this file is placed in the Data folder.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook(jupyter notebook via your local terminal)  or collabs:
a.  Running the Jupyter Notebook on collabs or Jupiter notebook after downloaded the notebook
b. Open the Notebook on collabs or jupiter Navigate to the Scripts folder and open Twitter_sentiment_analysis_Group6.ipynb.
c. Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

4. Data Preprocessing
The notebook includes steps for:
Loading the dataset.
Cleaning the tweets by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing stemming.
Tokenizing the cleaned tweets.

5 . Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes visualizations such as:
. Word clouds to visualize frequent words in the dataset.
. Distribution of positive and negative labels.

6. Sentiment Analysis
The notebook includes:
. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
. Training a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) on the preprocessed data.
. Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and other metrics.

7. Saving Results
The results of the analysis, including visualizations and model outputs, are saved in the Outputs folder.

# Dependencies
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
seaborn: For enhanced visualizations.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation.

# Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. 
By following the instructions, you can reproduce the results and gain insights into the sentiment expressed in the tweets.
